      Redis is an in-memory database but does write data to disk periodically for recovery. The location of this dump file can be found at `/data/dump.rdb`. By putting `/data` on to a persistent volume, the data will survive container restarts.

      You can find more about redis persistence on the [redis website](https://redis.io/topics/persistence).

        Redis can be started with a configuration file to customize or tweak how the cluster will run. This file is commonly named `redis.conf`.

        Assume /path/to/your/redis.conf is the configuration file on your local host.
